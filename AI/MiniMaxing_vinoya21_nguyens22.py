#AIPlayer
#Description: The responsbility of this class is to interact with the game by
#deciding a valid move based on a given game state. This class has methods that
#will be implemented by students in Dr. Nuxoll's AI course.
#
#Variables:
#   playerId - The id of the player.
##

    #__init__
    #Description: Creates a new Player
    #
    #Parameters:
    #   inputPlayerId - The id to give the new player (int)
    #   cpy           - whether the player is a copy (when playing itself)

    #   the player's side; 1 tunnel on player's side; 9 grass on the
    #   player's side; and 2 food on the enemy's side.

    #Parameters:
    #   construction - the Construction to be placed.
